    <h1> Common Sense </h1>
    <p>Common sense is not a genetically inherited trait. Its a character that everyone can develop. However, it takes alot of hardwork and commitment to improve them. <strong>Personality is malleable</strong> and can be altered for better; based on the preference of the person.</p>
    <br>Socially, we all are in high demand for common sense otherwise <mark> the pace of human development would be slowed down.</mark>
  <h2>Intelligence..</h2>
  <p>Similarly, intelligence is an acquired skill. Science has done its job in proving how someone can increase the neurological connections and agreed on the golden rule of 'Practice makes perfect'</p>
